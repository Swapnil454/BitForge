### What Was Changed

#### 1. **Backend - Product Model** 
- Added `changeRequest` field to track pending updates/deletions

- Added `changeRejectionReason` for feedback to sellers
- **File:** `server/src/models/Product.js`

#### 2. **Backend - Product Controller**
- Created `handleApprovedProductUpdate()` helper function
- Modified `updateProduct()` to allow editing approved products (submits for approval)
- Modified `deleteProduct()` to allow deleting approved products (submits for approval)
- Non-approved products continue to work as before (immediate changes)
- **File:** `server/src/controllers/product.controller.js`

#### 3. **Backend - Admin Controller**
- Added `getPendingProductChanges()` - retrieve products awaiting approval
- Added `approveProductChange()` - apply approved changes to products
- Added `rejectProductChange()` - reject changes and notify sellers
- Handles both update and deletion requests

#### 4. **Backend - Marketplace Controller**

- Products with pending changes are hidden from buyers
- **File:** `server/src/controllers/marketplace.controller.js`

#### 5. **Backend - Admin Routes**
- Added 3 new endpoints for change approval workflow
- **File:** `server/src/routes/admin.routes.js`

#### 6. **Frontend - Seller Dashboard**
- Enabled edit/delete buttons for approved products
- Added "Update pending" and "Deletion pending" status badges

##  How It Works

### Seller Flow
```
1. Seller edits an APPROVED product
   ↓
2. System sets changeRequest = "pending_update"
   ↓
3. Pending changes stored, product hidden from marketplace
   ↓
4. Seller sees "Update pending" badge on their product
   ↓
5. Admin approves/rejects the changes
   ↓
6. If approved: Changes live, product visible to buyers
   If rejected: Original state restored, seller sees rejection reason
```

### Admin Flow
```
1. Admin views pending product changes dashboard
   ↓
2. Admin reviews proposed changes
   ↓
3. Admin approves: Changes applied immediately, files updated
   OR
4. Admin rejects: Changes discarded, seller notified with reason
```

### Buyer Flow
```
Before approval: Product NOT visible (if pending changes)
After approval: Product visible with new content
If deletion rejected: Product remains visible
```

```javascript
{
  // Existing fields...
  status: "approved",
  
  // NEW - Change tracking

  pendingChanges: {
    title: "New Title",

    price: 99,
    discount: 15,
    fileKey: "...",
