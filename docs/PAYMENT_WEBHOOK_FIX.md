## 🚨 Current Problems

### 1. **Buyer Can't See Downloads**

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### **THE WEBHOOK IS FAILING!**

Your `.env` file has:
```env
RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=xxxx  ❌ THIS IS WRONG!
```

**What happens:**
1. User completes payment ✅
2. Razorpay sends webhook to your server ✅
3. Your server tries to verify webhook signature ❌
4. Signature verification **FAILS** (because secret is "xxxx") ❌
5. Webhook is **REJECTED** ❌
6. Order stays in "created" status forever ❌
7. No invoice created ❌
8. No revenue recorded ❌
9. Buyer can't download files ❌

## ✅ Complete Solution

### **Step 1: Get Real Webhook Secret**

1. Go to **Razorpay Dashboard**: https://dashboard.razorpay.com
2. Navigate: **Settings** → **Webhooks**
3. Find your webhook or create new one:
   - **URL**: `https://api.bittforge.in/api/webhooks/razorpay`
   - **Events**: Select `payment.captured`
4. **Copy the Webhook Secret** (looks like: `whsec_aBcDeFgHiJkLmNoPqRs`)

### **Step 2: Update Production Environment**

On **Render.com**:
1. Go to your server dashboard
2. Click **Environment**
3. Find `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
4. Replace `xxxx` with the **real webhook secret**
5. Click **Save**
6. Server will auto-redeploy

### **Step 3: Test the Fix**

1. **Make a test purchase** (₹10 or your minimum amount)
2. **Check Render Logs** immediately - You should see:

```log
==> ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
==> Webhook received: payment.captured
==> Timestamp: 2026-02-09T10:30:45.123Z
==> ✅ Webhook signature verified
==> 💰 Payment captured: pay_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
==> Order ID: order_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
==> Amount: 10 INR
==> ✅ Order updated to PAID: 676abc123def456
==> Product: Your Product Name
==> Buyer: buyer@example.com
==> Platform Fee: ₹ 1
==> Seller Amount: ₹ 9
==> ✅ Invoice created: INV-2026-001234
==> ✅ Buyer notified
==> ✅ Seller notified
==> ✅ Webhook processed successfully
==> ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
```

### **Step 4: Verify Everything Works**

✅ **Buyer Dashboard:**
- Shows purchased products
- Download button appears
- Product is downloadable

✅ **Admin Dashboard:**
- Revenue increases by platform fee (10% of sale)
- Transaction appears in recent transactions
- Invoice is generated

✅ **Seller Dashboard:**
- Sees new order
- Seller amount calculated correctly

## 💰 Understanding Money Flow

### **This is the CORRECT flow:**

```
User Pays ₹100
    ↓
Razorpay Account (You receive ₹100)
    ↓
Auto Settlement (Daily/Weekly)
    ↓
Your Bank Account (₹100 arrives)
    ↓
You manually pay sellers
```

**Important:**
- ✅ Money going to Razorpay account is **NORMAL and CORRECT**
- ✅ Razorpay automatically settles to your registered bank account
- ✅ You pay sellers manually from your account
- ✅ Platform keeps 10% commission automatically (tracked in database)

## 🔍 How to Check Webhook Logs

### **If webhook fails, you'll see:**

```log
==> ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
==> Webhook received: payment.captured
==> ❌ Invalid webhook signature!
==> Expected: a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0...
==> Received: z9y8x7w6v5u4t3s2r1q0...
==> This means RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET is incorrect!
==> ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
```

**Solution:** Update webhook secret with correct value from Razorpay dashboard.

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

### Check these:

1. **Webhook URL Active?**
   - Razorpay Dashboard → Webhooks
   - Status should be "Active"

2. **Events Selected?**
   - Must have `payment.captured` checked

3. **Test Mode vs Live Mode?**
   - Use Test webhook secret for test mode
   - Use Live webhook secret for live mode
   - Don't mix them!

4. **Check Render Logs:**
   ```bash
   # Look for these patterns
   ==> Webhook received
   ==> ✅ Webhook signature verified
   ==> ✅ Order updated to PAID
   ```

5. **Still failing?**
   - Delete webhook in Razorpay
   - Create new webhook
   - Copy NEW secret
   - Update in Render
   - Test again

## 📝 Notes

- **RazorpayX NOT Needed**: Manual payouts work fine
- **Money Flow is Correct**: Razorpay → Your Bank is normal
- **Webhook is Critical**: Without it, nothing works after payment
- **Secret Must Match**: Webhook secret from Razorpay dashboard must exactly match your `.env`

---

**Fix Priority: 🔥 CRITICAL - Do this immediately!**

The entire post-payment flow depends on webhooks working correctly.
